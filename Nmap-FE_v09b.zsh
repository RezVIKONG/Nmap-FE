# NOTE: unfortunately the parameter --scanflags doesn't work with Ping Scan but only with Port Scans such as -sS -sA, so to do a Host Discovery using TCP SYN-ACK flags (both enabled) we should create a NSE script

	# NOTE: with the same parameters mentioned before, a scan as "-T2 --min-rate 10 --max-rate 100" needs a little more than 5 HOURS to complete - the EXACTLY SAME Scan Time as "-T3 --min-rate 0.01 --max-rate 100 --max-parallelism 1" BUT having '--min-rate 0.01' give Nmap the ability to slow down to 1 Packet every 100 Seconds if the network becomes temporarily unrielable or in the case of rate limiting by a FW/IPS.
	# NOTE: Parallelism >1 is only available to -T3 -T4 -T5 timings - but keep in mind that with an high parallelism Nmap could send that --max-parallelism amount in a very short time frame (as a burst of a couple packets sent)
	# NOTE: by using a --max-parallelism as low as 1 (no parallel port scan) we create a Destination Port Pattern EASILY NOTICEABLE with both -T2 and -T3 timings because Nmap scan the same Destination Port consecutively 2 times and it does the same for the next ports - instead with a BALANCE between '--max-parallelism' and '--max-rate' the Destination Port Pattern is a lot more variable and we can also improve total scan time.
	# NOTE: an Optimized scan (see below $NmapScanParameters) with timing "-T3 --min-rate 0.01 --max-rate 49 --max-parallelism 49" takes 45 MINUTES to complete and has a nice random Destination Port Pattern and time between probes.

# *** TO DO NEXT *** 
# N.1 Wazuh/Snort Nmap scan Detection Bypass
#
# N.2 Emulate a DNS SYN-ACK Reply over TCP with Data Length over 512 bytes and Emulate HTTPS SYN-ACK Reply with (--data) containing a Certificate
# TCP SYN-ACK flags - both enabled - ONLY possible with (-sS --scanflags SYNACK) but not very usefull because Nmap is in Port Scan mode and not in Host Discovery - so to do Host Discovery that way we must create a custom NSE script
# 
# N.3 Implement Port Knocking 
# To unlock SSH (port 22), first port-knock with one of the following sequences:
# - 100, 200, 300 (all TCP)
# - 571, 290, 911, 115 (all TCP)
# - 1234, 5678, 9012 (all TCP)
# - 7000, 8000, 9000 (all TCP)
# - 8881, 7777, 9991 (all TCP)
# - 1000, 2000, 3000 (all UDP)
# - 1234, 5678, 9012 (all UDP) 
# To unlock Telnet (port 23), first port-knock with 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 (all UDP)
# To unlock RDP (port 3389), first port-knock with 1111:tcp, 2222:udp, 3333:tcp, 4444:udp, 5555:tcp
# To unlock HTTPS (port 443), first port-knock with 1000, 2000, 3000 (all TCP)
# To unlock VPN (port 1194), first port-knock with 1111, 2222, 3333, 4444 (all UDP)
